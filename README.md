# Sales-Price-Analysis-
Basic Summary :- Used multiple Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Sales prices of houses from the Ames Dataset.

Detailed Summary:-

In this project I examined a comprehensive housing dataset from the city of Ames in Iowa, USA (source). Homeowners looking to increase the value of their homes often spend too much on remodeling and don't get the return on investment when selling the house. On the other hand, people looking to buy houses want to get the best house possible given a budget. The goal of this project is to address some of these concerns, specifically:

    what features add the most value to a home, and which hurt home values the most?
    given a set of features, what is the expected sale price of a house?
    given a budget, what kind of house would one be able to afford?

To answer these questions, I fitted different models to the housing data in order to determine the features that are most influential on house price, and those that have the least effect. The performance of the models will be evaluated using the R2 metric, which is a measure of how much the model is able to explain the variance in the dataset.
